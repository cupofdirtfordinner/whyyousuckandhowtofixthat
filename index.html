<h1>How you hurt the environment <br>
(without knowing)</h1>
<p>
People often do not realize the impact of their carbon footprint. Your carbon footprint, left by your usage of  devices such as your car or phone, can be a direct lead to global warming.
Most people have things like cars or houses, or electronic devices like phones or laptops. The more people use these things, the more pollution goes into the earth; causing global warming to progress. One example of this is the pollution of water, often caused by things like oil spills, which leads to corruption of the food chain. The fish die from chemicals, meaning the birds can't eat fish, and now all the algae the fish ate will overpopulate, so on and so on. Another example is the pollution of the air. caused by things like smoke or other unhealthy gasses being released, usually by gas fueled cars or large factories, this can make areas (especially highly urbanized areas, industrialized areas, or populated areas) unsafe to breathe in. People can gain things like lung cancer
A popular misconception of global warming is that it is just warming up the atmosphere. In reality, global warming has all kinds of effects on the global climate. One example of this was the massive snow storm in Texas in march of 2021. Well over two feet of snow fell on Texas from the (date) to the (date), and caused rolling power outages and many deaths due to lack of heating and access to food.
Of course, this isnâ€™t all because of you. However, you can help. And with enough people all pitching in, we can fix climate change as a whole.
