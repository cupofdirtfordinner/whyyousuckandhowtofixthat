<h1>Why you suck</h1>
<p>Carbon footprint is something not many people know about (or at least dont care enough <br/> about), despite it being an extreme factor to society and our future. Your carbon footprint <br/> impacts the world more than you think because each time you go anywhere in your car it <br/> contributes to global warming. Global warming is when gasses like methane and carbon <br/> monoxide gets stuck in our atmosphere and traps heat.
